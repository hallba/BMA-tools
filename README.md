# BMA-tools

Tools and scripts to support work with BioModelAnalyzer (https://github.com/hallba/BioModelAnalyzer).

Code here is included for usefulness, and not heavily curated. If tools mature, they will be migrated 
to dedicated repositories but this repo is intended primarily for experimental or extremely simple
programs.
